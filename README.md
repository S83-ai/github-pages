<h1>Cloud Native Applications</h1><br>
<br>
<p>The term "cloud native" has emerged as a buzzword in the tech industry, representing a significant shift in the approach to designing, developing, and deploying software applications. Some sources characterize cloud native as an approach where developers design applications to excel in a cloud environment from the outset, while others highlight the importance of containerization in achieving cloud native status. "cloud native" represents a paradigm shift and an industry standard. It embodies an approach to developing, operating, and monitoring production-grade applications in modern environments, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. This approach leads to faster time to market, improved customer engagements, and spots performance and security issues before they occur. Cloud plays an essential role in business growth and success.</p>
<b><i>Key characteristics of cloud native applications are :</i></b><br>

•	Micro services architecture.</li>
•	Containerisation and Container Orchestration.</li> 
•	Cloud computing design. </li>
•	Adherence to DevOps principles. </li>
•	Statelessness.</li> 
•	Infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure utilization. </li>
•	API communication. </li>
•	Observability Incorporation. 
<br>
Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a subsidiary of the Linux Foundation that operates on an open-source basis, is dedicated to simplifying this process. The modern tech industry heavily relies on CNCF projects to enhance a multitude of applications for organizations and companies, allowing them to embrace the cloud-native approach. <br>
<b><i>FUTURE TREND IN CLOUD NATIVE APPLICATIONS</i></b>
<br>
•	Serverless computing.<br>
•	Edge computing. <br>
•	Kubernetes and beyond - Kubernetes, the de facto standard for container orchestration, continues to evolve. It's extending its reach to cover more use cases, from managing machine learning workloads to serverless deployments. Additionally, Kubernetes-native platforms like OpenShift are becoming popular for enterprises.<br>
•	DevOps and GitOps. <br>
•	AI and Machine Learning integration. <br>
•	Stateful Applications. <br>
•	Green cloud computing. <br>
